#Isa-Code
Good day! My name is Isa Miguel Salva, or just Isa for short. I come from General Trias, Cavite. I chose Computer Science because I have always been fascinated by technology. I also hope to one day make or take part in making video games so I can give others the rich experiences that I have had myself.
